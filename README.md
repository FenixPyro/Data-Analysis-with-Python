# Data Analysis Practice Projects

This repository contains a collection of small projects aimed at practicing Data Analysis skills. These projects are based on exercises from FreeCodeCamp.

## Projects Included

- **Project 1**: A calculator that uses NumPy to calculate some statistical data from a list.
- **Project 2**: A demographic data analyzer made with Pandas.
- **Project 3**: Explore correlations and visualize health insights using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Pandas.
- **Project 4**: Visualize time series data of daily page views from the freeCodeCamp.org forum using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
- **Project 5**: Analyze and predict global average sea level change from 1880 to 2050 using Pandas, Matplotlib, and SciPy.

Each project folder includes a README with specific details, datasets used (if any), and the steps or analyses performed.
